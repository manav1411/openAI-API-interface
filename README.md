# openAI-API-interface
creates a visually pleasing interface OpenAI API tokens.

**instructions**:
1. pip install all the dependency warnings you get. (use pip3 if you're using python3)
2. run the program by doing python gpt4.py (or python3 gpt4.py if you're using python3)
3. write your query (can be multiple lines). press cmd+d when done.
4. get the gpt4 response!


**use case**:

gpt plus is prohibitivley expensive. The gpt API is significantly cheaper, however it was intedneded to be used by developers for client-facing applications. To even send a simple query to the OpenAI API, significant work is required - which is where my python script comes in.

This python program, when executed, provides a simple request/result interface for the user (you can even have an input of multiple lines!). Internally, it processes queries and sends the requests to the API servers, processes the results, and beautifully outputs to the client.
